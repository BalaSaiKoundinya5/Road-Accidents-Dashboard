**Road Accidents Dashboard Analysis (2021-2022) – India**

**Project Overview**

This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze road accident data in India for the years 2021 and 2022. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a clear, visual representation of the trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to road accidents, aiding stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to enhance road safety.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Accident Trend Analysis:** Identify and visualize trends in road accidents over the two years.
1. **Geographical Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of accidents across different states and cities in India.
1. **Cause Identification:** Determine the leading causes of road accidents, including human error, environmental factors, and vehicle-related issues.
1. **Severity Assessment:** Evaluate the severity of accidents, including the number of fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
1. **Time-Based Patterns:** Identify peak times and seasons for accidents to inform preventive measures.

**Data Source**

The dataset includes detailed records of road accidents across India from 2021 to 2022, containing information such as:

- **Accident ID:** Unique identifier for each accident
- **Date and Time:** Specifics of when each accident occurred
- **Location:** Details of the accident site, including state, city, and exact location
- **Severity:** Information on the number of fatalities, injuries, and the extent of damage
- **Cause:** Recorded cause(s) of the accident
- **Vehicle Information:** Types of vehicles involved in the accidents
- **Environmental Conditions:** Weather, road conditions, and visibility at the time of the accident

**Key Features**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  - Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting data for analysis
- **Dashboard Features:**
  - **Time-Series Analysis:** Monthly and yearly accident trends
  - **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping accidents to visualize hotspots and regions with high accident rates
  - **Cause Analysis:** Breakdown of accidents by cause to identify primary risk factors
  - **Severity Analysis:** Visualization of the severity of accidents across different areas and periods
  - **Time-of-Day Analysis:** Identification of high-risk times during the day and night
- **Interactive Visualizations:**
  - **Dynamic Filters:** Allow users to drill down into specific data points, such as filtering by region, time, or cause
  - **Charts and Graphs:** Includes line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps for clear data interpretation
  - **Pivot Tables:** For detailed exploration of data by different dimensions

**Tools and Techniques**

- **Microsoft Excel:** The primary tool for data processing, analysis, and dashboard creation.
  - **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts:** For summarizing and visualizing data
  - **Conditional Formatting:** To highlight key trends, anomalies, and critical data points
  - **Formulas and Functions:** To automate calculations and enhance the interactivity of the dashboard
  - **Slicers:** For easy data filtering and selection in the dashboard
  - **Maps and Geospatial Tools:** To visualize the geographical distribution of accidents

**Conclusion**

This project delivers a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides insights into road accidents across India during 2021 and 2022. The insights gained can support policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety organizations in developing targeted interventions to reduce accidents and enhance road safety.
